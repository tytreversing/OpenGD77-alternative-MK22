 * for specific chip. Complete list contains:
 *  mode - Kinetis power mode. List of available modes is chip-specific. See power_manager_modes_t
 *   list of modes. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  enableLowPowerWakeUpOnInterrupt - When set to true, system exits to Run mode when any interrupt occurs while in
 *   Very low power run, Very low power wait or Very low power stop mode. This item is chip-specific.
 *  enablePowerOnResetDetection - When set to true, power on reset detection circuit is disabled in
 *   Very low leakage stop 0 mode. When set to false, circuit is enabled. This item is chip-specific.
 *  enableRAM2Powered - When set to true, RAM2 partition content is retained through Very low
 *   leakage stop 2 mode. When set to false, RAM2 partition power is disabled and memory content lost.
 *   This item is chip-specific.
 *  enableLowPowerOscillator - When set to true, the 1 kHz Low power oscillator is disabled in any
 *   Low leakage or Very low leakage stop mode. When set to false, oscillator is enabled in these modes.
